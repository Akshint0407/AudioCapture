## Requirements

To run the Voice Recorder application, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

1. **`pyaudio`**  
   - Used for audio input and recording. The library provides bindings for PortAudio, a cross-platform audio library.
   
2. **`pyautogui`**  
   - Used to simulate keyboard input and control the Notepad application by typing out the transcribed speech.

3. **`SpeechRecognition`**  
   - Used to convert speech input into text. The library supports various speech-to-text engines like Google Web Speech API.

4. **`wave`**  
   - A built-in Python library to handle audio file manipulation and save the recorded audio as a `.wav` file. No installation is required as it comes with Python by default.

5. **`threading`**  
   - A built-in Python module to allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks like audio recording and GUI updates simultaneously.

6. **`datetime`**  
   - A built-in Python module to generate timestamps for naming the audio files based on the current date and time.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyaudio pyautogui SpeechRecognition
